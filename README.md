The development of GHEX is supported partly by The Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE). PRACE is an international non-profit association with its seat in Brussels. The PRACE Research Infrastructure provides a persistent world-class high performance computing service for scientists and researchers from academia and industry in Europe. The computer systems and their operations accessible through PRACE are provided by 5 PRACE members (BSC representing Spain, CINECA representing Italy, ETH Zurich/CSCS representing Switzerland, GCS representing Germany and GENCI representing France). The Implementation Phase of PRACE receives funding from the EUâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (2014-2020) under grant agreement 823767.
